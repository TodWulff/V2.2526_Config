Here is my take on passing print-specific slice-time parameters from slicer (Cura in this case) to
klipper programmatically:

Set up slicer to emit comments with various print parameters embedded as comments in the gcode.
Some might be automatically added when sliced, others will require overt config to get it to do so.
My frame of reference is Cura and I've no idea if other slicers offer this sort of functionality.

Replacement patterns to use to get specific slicer vitals and print-specific parameters in cura,
as gcode comments can be viewed here:

A quick example:  My slicer automatically adds a print's max z height comment to each gcode file generated:

I added a plugin to Cura to allow me to post-process the sliced gcode before it is processed for saving.

Therein, I set up a regex find & replace:

Search Pattern: (;MAXZ:)(.*)
Replace Pattern: \1\2\n_SET_MAXZ Z=\2

Now, whenever cura slices a file, as longs as the plugin is active, it'll automagically add a new line
thereafter which calls a [gcode_macro] I've instantiated in klipper:

calls this code, passing the print specific parameter to it, whenever this gcode is printed
