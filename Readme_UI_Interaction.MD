Note that the files herein may not be the latest - 'production' code is attainable via my printer config:
https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_user_interaction.cfg and
https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_ui_test.cfg

Here is an example of a real world use case - optionally keeping heaters on & unloading filament @ print end:

Other cases in which I employ this module in my daily printing workflow:

- During an Idle Timeout event, give user ability to cancel the shutdown, to proceed, and to upload configs and then proceed,
  with null-input timeout to default to proceed with the shutdown (as imaged).

![https://i.imgur.com/mZ7V0rl.png](https://i.imgur.com/mZ7V0rl.png)

- At print start, if system cpu utilization exceeds a threshold, go interactive to give user an opportunity to resolve the issue (wait for the host to settle down (i.e. if transcoding a timelapse from a prior print), or to change the threshold value via the console).

![https://i.imgur.com/RYv5SMl.png](https://i.imgur.com/RYv5SMl.png)

- At print start, if extrusion factor or speed factor is not 100%, go interactive to give user option to reset each to 100% before commencing the print:

![https://i.imgur.com/v5AvWXp.png](https://i.imgur.com/v5AvWXp.png)

- At print canx/end, give user opportunity to retain heater settings, or to turn heaters off;
- At print canx/end, give user option to retain or unload filament (12-color Multi-Material ERCF here);
- At print end, give user opportunity to push current configs up to github repo, for historization and disaster recovery purposes:
	- The '_git_repo_ops' macro set has been enhanced to query the user for a 1-72 character commit summary message

- Using UI to enable SomaFM Web Streamed Radio channel selection by displaying an index of channel names/numbers and querying the user to make a selection:

![https://i.imgur.com/IKu9OLo.png](https://i.imgur.com/IKu9OLo.png)

- During calibration of ERCF Filament Encoder, for each color/cart, give user ability to restart the calibration or to accept same and continue
- Used UI module during testing of various hardware items (i.e. servo throw angle determinations for v0.1 nozzle scrubber and side swipe klicky/euclid bed probes)
- ... more that I cannot recall right now


## USER-SUBMITTED USE CASES:

Thanks to Discord User Beatzoid#8010 for providing this fine example.


## PREREQUISITES:

Heavily relies on `[Save_Variables]` module
see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_persistent_variables.cfg

Makes use of **`M300`** and some custom **`M300_`** related macros I mucked with for emitting sounds, so if you're not so
interested, or haven't a beeper on your box, comment out related lines: `_ui_reminder`, `_annunciate_input_exception`,
and `_annunciate_good_input` - see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_m300_sounds.cfg

Makes heavy use of the **`[response]`** module - I've trapped the stock M118 (using rename_existing) with gcode such
that it uses action_notification vs. FW M118 code.  This enables emission of 'special characters' that M118's
FW code chokes on - see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_gcode_macros.cfg

Throughout my configs, virtually all gcode macros have been 'instrumented' - the first and last lines of each gcode block can be deleted.
I have these as I have an ability to trace macro code execution and display same in the console - quite powerful for macro development/
troubleshooting but of little/no use to others, with rare exception - 
see: https://github.com/TodWulff/V2.2526_Config/blob/main/_debug_trace.cfg

Users should consider adding a User Input macro pane, as depicted below - which calls macros herein.  
Orienting it under the console pane will allow it to become intuitive with a small bit of use.  Author's UI of choice is Mainsail.  
For Fluidd or other Moonraker Clients (Mooncord/Telegram Bot/...), I defer to others to adapt the macros for use therein.

## Primary Macro:  GET_USER_INPUT  Parameters and related dialog follows

Optional Parameters:

**`PROMPT`**		Quoted Text to display in console as a user input prompt.  Promts are vistually separated from balance
of console context via a dashed line being displayed before and after the prompt (see images below).

**`RCVR_MACRO`**	Macro name to run when VALID input received - UI_INPUT param, containing user input contents is 
passed to the called macro - if required, the called user macro can query svv for additional details.

**`TYPE`**		The TYPE of input needed - one of these three string/str, integer/int, float/flt

**`BOUNDS_HI`**	if TYPE is float/flt, input must be >=lo and <=hi - for integer/int, input must be >=floor(lo) and <=ceiling(hi)

**`BOUNDS_LO`**	 - if string/str TYPE, character count must be >=floor(lo) and <=ceiling(hi)

**`TO_PERIOD`**		Period in Integer seconds to wait for user input

**`RMDR_PERIOD`**	Overrides the default reminder period set in \_ui_vars while waiting for user input

**`EXCPT_HDLR`**	Macro name is called in the event of an input timeout or faulty input - no params passed - query svv...

**`TO_CYCL_DEF`**	iterations of timeouts before TO_RESP_DEF is sent as UI_INPUT to RCVR_MACRO - default: -1 to disable behavior

**`TO_RESP_DEF`**	UI_INPUT value to be passed if TO_CYCL_DEF count reaches 0 when decremented @ timeout

For string TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to 1.

For string TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 255.

For float TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to -999999999.0.

For float TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 999999999.0.

For integer TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_LO`** is not asserted, defaults to -999999999.

For integer TYPE, if **`BOUNDS_HI`** is not asserted, defaults to 999999999

If additional bounds testing is desired/required, it's up to the user implementing this on their printers to craft more granular
test and validation - by way of the **`RCVR_MACRO`**.  If I've blantantly missed something, then let me know. :)

For optional parameters, read the code to understand implications of relying on defaults.

Again, ALL parameters are optional and default to something (depicted in the following):

	PROMPT="Awaiting User Input:"		displayed on the console at macro start as a user prompt
	TYPE=STRING				'string'('str') or 'integer'('int') or 'float'('flt') - for buttons use string
	BOUNDS_LO=1				min string chars or min numercial value (Int/Flt -999999999)
	BOUNDS_HI=255				max string chars or max numercial value (Int/Flt  999999999)
	RCVR_MACRO="_test_show_user_input"	to accept param UI_INPUT that will be an int/flt/"string" that was 
						input and passes sniff test (simple bounding checks)
	TO_PERIOD=120				in seconds
	EXCPT_HDLR="_ui_exception_handler"	no params passed to this proc - use svv to get runtime specifics if needed
	TO_CYCL_DEF=-1				
	TO_RESP_DEF="NULL"			if TO_CYCLES >=0, this param will be passed to RCVR_MACRO via UI_INPUT if no user input received
	RMDR_PERIOD=15				reminder bleeps every n seconds - 0 will disable reminder beeps

Also, there are four other module macro variables that affect the function of the macros  

	variable_ui_input_check_recurse_period:	  0.5	# seconds - period between checking for input when expected - 0.5s is good - less leads to more host
							# cycle consumption, larger leads to reduced perceived responsiveness
	variable_ui_reminder_enable:		  1	# bool 1/0 - 0 overtly disables reminder bleeps regardless of RMDR_PERIOD param
	variable_ui_enable_input_hints:		  0	# bool 1/0 - defaults to disabling hints on input prompt
	variable_ui_disable_exception_hints:	  0	# bool 1/0 - defaults to enabling hints on an exception event
	
	These can be programmatically altered during runtime via use of SET_GCODE_VARIABLE gcode command - i.e.:

		SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=_ui_vars VARIABLE=ui_enable_input_hints VALUE=1

### Example call follows:
This call looks for a user to enter a string 1-12 chars long, with a timeout of 60 secs, that forwards (via UI_INPUT param),
the entered string to the '_test_show_user_input' macro (default if no RCVR_MACRO passed by user call)
If a timeout happens/faulty input is detected, the _ui_timeout_watchdog/_validate_user_input macros call '_ui_exception_handler' macro
(which is the default exception handler if no EXCPT_HDLR macro name is passed by the user call)

`get_user_input` `PROMPT="Enter/click something:"` `TYPE=string` `BOUNDS_LO=1` `BOUNDS_HI=12` `RCVR_MACRO=_test_show_user_input` `TO_PERIOD=60` `EXCPT_HDLR=_ui_exception_handler`

## EXCEPTION HANDLER MACRO:
if a custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro is to be instantiated, it may prove useful to consider the following:
 - **`GET_USER_INPUT`** does the following:
   - initializes states and then displays the user **`PROMPT`**
   - sets the timeout watchdog to fire after the asserted (120s default) **`TO_PERIOD`**
   - puts **`_await_user_input`** into a recursive loop, non-blocking while waiting, with a period defined in _ui_vars
 - a single **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro services both bad input cases as well as the time-out when waiting on user input.
 - for timeouts the **default** **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro simply recalls **`GET_USER_INPUT`** giving user another input context
   - this approach can be altered with a custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`** macro being passed to the **`GET_USER_INPUT`** call
 - When `_await_user_input` detects input from user, `_validate_user_input` tests for **`TYPE`** and **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliance
   - if input is NOT **`TYPE`** & **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliant, `_await_user_input` recalls **`GET_USER_INPUT`** so user can fix it
   - if input IS **`TYPE`** & **`BOUNDS_HI`**/**`BOUNDS_LO`** compliant (flag `_ui_bad_input` NOT set), input is sent to **`RCVR_MACRO`** via **`UI_INPUT`** param

In most conceivable use cases, the default exception handler/validation macros should be adequate.  However, author decided to give others
options, in the event something wasn't adequately considered.  Either an entirely new **`EXCPT_HDLR`** can be crafted or, as demonstrated
in _ui_test.cfg's `_ui_test_exception_handler` (custom **`EXCPT_HDLR`**) code runs and then chains to the stock `_ui_exception_handler` below

In `_ui_vars` macro, a person implementing this can selectively enable/disable Input Prompt and/or Exception hints.  Hints are
little descriptive blurbs as to what the macro is expecting as input - one can enable hints on either the input prompt,
or disable hints when an input exception is detected/raised.  It is suggested that it is likely best to have exception
hints enabled, and to have the input prompt detail what sort of input is desired, leaving input hints disabled.
The `_ui_test.cfg` file has the START_DEMO macro that iterates through some UI input event - I used it for dev testing,
it works as a demo.

## Some visual examples as it relates to the hint options that can be set in `_ui_vars`:

No Hints on Exception nor Input Prompt: https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png (likely too terse - user should make the preamble/prompt detailed)

![https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/PDPOmTJ.png)

Hints on Exception only, not on Input Prompt:  https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png (the author's preference)

![https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png](https://i.imgur.com/D5Ih6hE.png)

Hints on Input Prompt but not on an Exception:  https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png (leads to some noise, which may be tolerable)

![https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png](https://i.imgur.com/Deo2SNr.png)

Hints on both Input Prompt and when an exception is raised:  https://i.imgur.com/mO7TfWW.png (likely redundant, imo)
