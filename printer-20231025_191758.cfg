## Regarding [stepper_z] below, specifically 'position_endstop = 0.475':
## 0.675 goin in - 0.705 (28Apr22) w/ Stock FB plate - 0.400 w/ new build surface from 3DHub.ca
## (double sided pei sheet) this is the distance from the switch trigger point to the build plate:
## positive is above build plate, negative is below thus increasing the value will cause the
## FW to push the nozzle lower to get to the bed - i.e. 0.350 nets a higher nozzle position
## position wrt the bed than does 0.500. Just know that larger = a lower nozzle, and be careful.
## memory aid - teeter totter... More positive, moar closer.

## yep, I'm slow AF on the update of some things...
## OK this is starting to make more sense. I put the stock fb plate back on and have to have a -0.375
## z-offset in Mainsail UI, considering the 'position_endstop = 0.475' below. So, the math reveals
## that a new value of 0.85 is warranted for the stock FB plate. will try and see if I destroy stuffs
## no issues. works well. only thing of note is that the 'polarity' of the z-offset setting in mainsail
## is non-teetertotter - a larger negative value in that UI represents closer to the bed. one can be
## cornfuzed if one isn't aware of the bi-polarness of the printer config's position endstop when
## considering the z-offset. Ok, the horse is bloody. Happy printing.

## 28Feb23 So 0.850 was set. then did a bunch of z_cals and determined that 0.350 offset was warranted in ui. saved it via ui and applied it to endsop resulting in 0.500
