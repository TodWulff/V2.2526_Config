Good day.
I'm considering migrating away from KVP due to perceived quality issues on my recent orders.
I've ~15 master spools (1KG size) that I have been refilling with their 1.75mm Filament Koils. I am writing to request dimensions of your 1.75mm master spool ABS filaments. Can you please email me a drawing, or otherwise advise salient details (ID,OD,Thickness)? Thank you, in advance.

Polymaker is a good afforable option for a lot of different materials
IC3D makes good ABS
3DXTech has good selections of materials
Protopasta has nice looking PLA and PETG
Fusion Filaments has everything
Paramount3D for tons of ABS colors
Also FormFutura is great too, but can be kind of a pain to get here since they're european
Usually available on amazon
Prusament is solid too if you get 2 spools at a time to save a bit on shipping per spool
