I'd describe the ERCF as being super needy in terms of repeatability to work properly...
But the more accurate you can build and tune it the more reliable it'll work...

My three biggest advice I can give:

1) Make sure the D-Shaped Axle doesn't resemble a Banana ( glancing angrily towards DFH )

2) Replace the 3D printed 80T Pulley with a proper Metal one.

3) 3D print a Spacer that goes between any of the Bearings and the BMGs sitting on the D-Shaft otherwise you run the risk of them wandering out of their Bearing Block Cavity not supporting the D-Shaft anymore.

1a) I too had to replace my dfh d-shaft.  I ended up going with a stainless round shaft from amazonia
	and then used a dremel with fiber reinforced grinding wheel to nub flats onto the shaft where the
	gears grub screws went.  
	
2a) I've a metal 80T on order.

3a) Haven't any issues with the block bearings wandering, but it does make sense - 
	when I blow mine apart for the metal 80T, I'll likely do this.

Additional elements of feedback from MHz:

4) Larger cart count = more sensitivity.  If you only need 4 or 6 colors, get a 4 or 6 cart ercf.
   In hind sight, with my getting the 12-cart, I've made my bed for this.  The longer shafts are
   subject to more flex, especially in the middle of the span.  And, with a larger part count, the
   law of averages/murphy will rear their effin heads.  If I was doing it all again, I would go with
   2ea 6-cart (or even 3ea 4-cart) ERCFs and just mod the macros to select with stepper/gear/servo.
   gets used (T0-5 vs. T6-11).  But I am very comfortable coding something like this up using Klipper/
   Jinja.  Other's might not be willing to tackle the software mods needed for such an implementation.

5) While not rooted in an ERCF issue, the ERCF can exaserbate a latent issue.  Dragon HF hotend (SF too?)
   seemingly has some organic issues with heat creep.  In a non-ercf context, a new duct insert/fan can
   usually help provide adequate airflow to stave off any heat creep, event in a heated chamber (v2.4).
   But, when performing a high-swap-density ercf print, the repeated and rapid color swaps can overcome any
   benefit perceived to be sattributed by the duct/fan.  I went with a Dragon WHF watercooled highflow unit.
   I'll advise outcomes as things get settled in.  Ifin you're running an Afterburner with a Phaetus HF/SF
   Dragon, even if you've the duct insert add-on therein, you may end up experiencing heat creep at 150-
   250 high-density swaps (from repeatedly pulling hot filament up through the HE).  I had the Dragon HF 
   and was chugging along quite nicely, until I decided on a MM print that was pretty intense with the
   swaps (a lot of very short extrusions) and then I discovered what others had previously described.  In
   an attempt to alleviate this, I've just installed a water-cooled Phaetus and will advise outcomes as
   soon as I get things back together and re-tuned.

6) A low-drama buffering solution is pretty critical.  For w/e reason, I got my arse kicked by the ERCP
   and ended up implementing a home-brew RMU-ish solution:

7) Bowden ID size dynamics...  A lot of the traffic herein reflects the sensitivity of this topic for the
   user base.  I was running 2.0/4.0 and, when I used a new filament type (MG Chemicals Gold ABS), the tip
   formed as a bulb vs. as expected with my other filaments (I typically run with KVP ABS).  That bulb got
   hung on a retract inside the extruder, just above the gears, at the edge of the bowden throat:  
   https://i.imgur.com/AKRK4wA.jpg  As such, commensurate with my installing  the water-cooled HE, I've 
   changed to a 3.0/4.0 reverse bowden from the encoder cart to the hot end.  Hopefully that will prove to
   lend a bit of tolerance to my setup.

8) Bowden ID chamfer:  Relatedly, I am heeding some advise I gleaned from other users herein:  Adding a
   chamfer to the ID should also help:  https://imgur.com/a/eEr7N4g

9) Don't over tighten the threaded M5 shafts - a wee bit loose is OK.  Too tight and things bind.  Mounting
   will provide adequate stiffness.

10) If you change anything, it is strongly suggested that, at a minimum, you re-run ercf_calibrate.  This goes
    for bowden lengths, bowden ID changes, top hat changes, simple maintenance, and maybe even filament changes
