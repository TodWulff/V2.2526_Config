#serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ.
#   This parameter must be provided when using a serial port.
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
#canbus_uuid:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the unique
#   chip identifier to connect to. This value must be provided when using
#   CAN bus for communication.
#canbus_interface:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the CAN
#   network interface to use. The default is 'can0'.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'cheetah', 'rpi_usb',
#   and 'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on
#   Arduino boards and clones. The 'cheetah' method is a special
#   method needed for some Fysetc Cheetah boards. The 'rpi_usb' method
#   is useful on Raspberry Pi boards with micro-controllers powered
#   over USB - it briefly disables power to all USB ports to
#   accomplish a micro-controller reset. The 'command' method involves
#   sending a Klipper command to the micro-controller so that it can
#   reset itself. The default is 'arduino' if the micro-controller
#   communicates over a serial port, 'command' otherwise.


#[printer]
#kinematics:
#   The type of printer in use. This option may be one of: cartesian,
#   corexy, corexz, hybrid_corexy, hybrid_corexz, rotary_delta, delta,
#   polar, winch, or none. This
#   parameter must be specified.
#max_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.


#initial_duration: 1.0
#   The duration of the initial delay (in seconds). If set to a
#   non-zero value the delayed_gcode will execute the specified number
#   of seconds after the printer enters the "ready" state. This can be
#   useful for initialization procedures or a repeating delayed_gcode.
#   If set to 0 the delayed_gcode will not execute on startup.
#   Default is 0.
